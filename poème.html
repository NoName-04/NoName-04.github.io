<h1 style="color:red"> <center> Fire and Ice by Robert Frost! </center> </h1>

<p> <center> Some say the world will end in fire,<br>
Some say in ice.<br>
From what I’ve tasted of desire<br>
I hold with those who favor fire.<br>
But if it had to perish twice,<br>
I think I know enough of hate<br>
To say that for destruction ice<br>
Is also great<br>
And would suffice.<center> </p>
